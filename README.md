## Installation

### i3 config

When you first start i3, you'll be asked to generate a config file. Generate it. It will be placed in ~/.config/i3/

Replace the file called "config" with the one found in my repository

### i3blocks config

You need to install font-awesome for the i3blocks bar to work. It is used for the various icons found in the bar. Font-awesome can be found [here](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

replace the /etc/i3blocks.conf with the config from this repository.
